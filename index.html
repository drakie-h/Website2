    <h2>Audio and Visuals of Halo Combat Evolved by Bungie</h2>
  <br>In this website I am analyzing the audio and visuals of Bungie's Halo Combat Evolved based on my video game studies. The Halo Combat Evolved game trailer is a perfect example of the audio and visual components put together into one single work of art. For now I will analyse a piece of audio from the antagonists of the videogame:<br>
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="Elite.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
<br><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="HaloCE2.mp4"type="video/mp4">
<br>This audio clip contains the sounds of the enemy aliens in Halo Combat Evolved called the Covenant Sangheili. These sounds include the death sounds of the Sangheili where they sort of cry and wail. Bungie could have not included crying death sounds when the enemies die so there must be a good reason.<br>
  
<br>Halo CE or Call of Duty Zombies</br>
