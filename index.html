    <h2>Audio and Visuals of Halo Combat Evolved by Bungie</h2>
  <br>In this website I am analyzing the audio and visuals of Bungie's Halo Combat Evolved based on my video game studies. The Halo Combat Evolved game trailer is a perfect example of the audio and visual components put together into one single work of art. For now I will analyse a piece of audio from the antagonists of the videogame:<br>
    
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="Elite.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
    
    <br>This audio clip contains the sounds of the enemy aliens in Halo Combat Evolved called the Covenant Sangheili. These sounds include the death sounds of the Sangheili where they sort of cry and wail. Bungie could have not included crying death sounds when the enemies die so there must be a good reason for including them.</br>
    <br>In The Skin Ego, Anzieu explains that crying can be a pure psychological reflex, and also later discusses the correlation of sound and infants (note 1). When a player kills a Sangheili in Halo and they hear their cries, it raises a multitude of questions within the player eliminating them. Were the aliens ever infants? How were the aliens raised? Do the Sangheili have a family? Are these enemies that the player is killing actually evil? Do the Sangheili have soles? These wails cause a psychological inner conflict within the player that can result in feelings of guilt.</center>
    <br>My theory is that Bungie included the alien death sounds in Halo Combat Evolved to produce the similar cognitive dissonances of war. Without these Sangheili wails, these beings are mindless monsters, but with their cries the enemies become personified whether they are human or not. The player begins to realize that the Covenant is actually a complicated intelligent species and not just vacuous savages.</center>
